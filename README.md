## Detection-of-Road-Lane-lines

Given a short video of road lane, named : lane_line.mp4, as dataset.
# Introduction: 

A Live Lane-Line Detection[Task-1] Systems built-in Python language is another Data Science project idea for beginners. A human driver receives lane detecting instruction from 
lines placed on the road in this project. The lines placed on the roads indicate where the lanes are located for human driving. It also refers to the vehicleâ€™s steering 
direction. This application is crucial for the development of self-driving cars. This application for the Data Science Project is critical for the development of self-driving cars.

A Road Lane Line Detection System is a key feature in modern vehicles, particularly for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. It uses forward-facing cameras and sometimes additional sensors like LiDAR or radar to capture real-time road images. These images are processed using computer vision algorithms to detect lane markings, helping the vehicle maintain its lane and enhance driving safety. This technology is essential for functions such as lane-keeping assistance and automated lane changes.
